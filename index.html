<H2>HIRING: machine learning research scientist</H2>

<P>
The Machine Learning Team at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, MD, has an open position for a machine learning research scientist. The NIMH is the leading federal agency for research on mental disorders and neuroscience, and part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
</P>

<H2>About the NIMH Machine Learning Team</H2>

<P>
Our mission is to help NIMH scientists use machine learning methods to
address a diverse set of research problems in clinical and cognitive
psychology and neuroscience. These range from identifying biomarkers
for aiding diagnoses to creating and testing models of mental
processes in healthy subjects. Our overarching goal is to use machine
learning to improve every aspect of the scientific process.
</P>
<P>
We work with many different data types,
including very large brain imaging datasets from various imaging
modalities, behavioral data, and picture and text corpora. We have
excellent computational resources, both of our own (tens of high-end GPUs for deep learning, several large servers) and shared within the NIH (a cluster with hundreds of thousands of CPUs, and hundreds of GPUs).
</P>

<P>
 As a machine learning research group, we develop new methods and publish in the main machine learning conferences (e.g. NeurIPS and ICLR), as well as in psychology and neuroscience journals. Many of our problems require devising research approaches that combine imaging and non-imaging data, and leveraging structured knowledge resources (databases, scientific literature, etc) to generate explanations and hypotheses. You can find more about our work and publications at

<H2>About the position</H2>

<P>
We are seeking candidates who are capable of combining machine learning, statistical, and domain-specific computational tools to solve practical data analysis challenges (e.g. designing experiments, generating and testing statistical hypotheses, training and interpreting predictive models, and developing novel models and methods). Additionally, candidates should be capable of visualizing and communicating findings to a broad scientific audience, as well as explaining the details of relevant methods to researchers in a variety of domains. 
</P>

<P>
Desirable experience that is not required, but will be considered very favorably:
<UL>
<LI>neuroimaging data processing and analysis (any MRI modality,
  as well as MEG and EEG)</LI>
<LI>other types of neural data (e.g. neural recording, calcium imaging)</LI>
<LI>modelling of human and animal learning and decision-making</LI>
<LI>Bayesian statistical modelling</LI>
</UL>
 Finally, you should have demonstrable experience programming in
languages currently used in data-intensive, scientific computing, such
as Python, MATLAB or R. Experience with handling large datasets in
high performance computing settings is also very valuable. Although this
position requires a Ph.D. in a STEM discipline, we will consider
applicants from a variety of backgrounds, as their research
experience is the most important factor.
</P>


<P>
This is an ideal position for someone who wants to establish a research career in method development and applications driven by scientific and clinical needs. Given our access to a variety of collaborators and large or unique datasets, there is ample opportunity to match research interests with novel research problems. We also maintain collaborations outside of the NIH, driven by our own research interests.
</P>
<P>
If you would like to be considered for this position, please send
francisco.pereira@nih.gov a CV, with your email serving as cover
letter. We especially encourage applications from women and members of
underrepresented groups. If you already have a research statement, please feel free to send that as well. There is no need for reference letters at this stage. Other inquiries are also welcome. Thank you for your attention and interest!
