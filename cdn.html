<H2>HIRING: Data Scientist / Data Analyst</H2>

<P>
The Unit on Computational Decision Neuroscience (CDN) at the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Research Program is seeking a
full-time Data Scientist/Data Analyst. The NIMH is the leading federal agency for research on mental disorders and neuroscience, and part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
</P>

<P>
The lab is focused on understanding the neural and computational bases
of adaptive and maladaptive decision-making and their relationship to
mental health. Current studies investigate how internal states lead to
biases in decision-making and how this exacerbated in mental health
disorders. Our approach involves a combination of computational
model-based tasks, questionnaires, biosensor data, fMRI, and
intracranial recordings. The main models of interest come from
neuroeconomics, reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, signal
detection, and information theory.
</P>

<P>
The main tasks for this position include but are not restricted to computational modeling of behavioral data from decision-making and other cognitive tasks, statistical analysis of task-based, clinical, and physiological and neuroimaging data, as well as data visualization for the purposes of scientific presentations, public communication, and academic manuscripts. The candidate is expected to demonstrate experience with best practices for the development of well-documented, reproducible programming pipelines for data analysis, that facilitate sharing and collaboration, and live up to our open-science philosophy, as well as to our data management and sharing commitments at NIH.
</P>

<P>
<U>No prior experience with psychiatry research</U> is needed but a familiarity with the constructs and models of interest in the lab (value-based learning and decision-making, metacognition, belief updating, emotion regulation, and/or effort-cost estimation) is desirable, as these are universally important for understanding adaptive healthy functioning and psychiatric disease.
</P>



<H2>About the position</H2>

<P>
The data analyst will work under the supervision of Dr. Silvia
Lopez-Guzman on projects that aim to understand (1) the process of
adaptively evaluating options and committing to a choice; (2) how
changes in internal and motivational states may abnormally shape
decisions in individuals with and without psychopathology; and (3) how
cognitive and metacognitive resources support these adaptive or
maladaptive decision-making processes. The CDN lab leverages the rich
clinical resources and computational expertise across the NIH, and
collaborates actively with labs that specialize on addiction,
depression, anxiety, and pain. The lab is an active part of a growing
community of expert labs on learning and decision-making who work
together to improve our understanding from the circuits and behavioral
neuroscience level to the human cognitive and clinical levels, making
this a unique opportunity for any scientist with an interest in
decision science and computational psychiatry.
</P>

<P>
This is an exciting opportunity for a candidate with established programming and analytic skills to work at the cutting edge of psychiatry research and computational cognitive neuroscience.
