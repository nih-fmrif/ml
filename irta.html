<H2>HIRING: machine learning research assistant</H2>

<P>
The Machine Learning Team at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, MD, has an open position for a research assistant, under the National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Training Award program.
</P>

<H2>About the NIMH Machine Learning Team</H2>

<P>
Our mission is to help NIMH scientists use machine learning methods to address a diverse set of research problems in clinical and cognitive psychology and neuroscience. These range from identifying biomarkers for aiding diagnoses to creating and testing models of mental processes in healthy subjects. Our overarching goal is to use machine learning to improve every aspect of the scientific effort, from helping discover or develop theories to generating actionable results.
</P>
<P>
We work with many different data types, e.g. very large brain imaging datasets in various imaging modalities, neural recordings, behavioral data, electronic health records, text transcripts and corpora. We have excellent computational resources, both of our own (tens of high-end GPUs for deep learning, several large servers) and shared within the NIH (a cluster with hundreds of thousands of CPUs, and hundreds of GPUs).
</P>

<H2>About the position</H2>

<P>
This is an ideal position for someone who plans on applying to graduate school in machine learning, biomedical engineering, (bio)statistics, or a related discipline, or on working as a professional data scientist. The work you will do, and the knowledge you will acquire in in the process, will equip you for a wide range of quantitative career paths. With your specific career goals in mind, we will guide you in developing your publication record and project portfolio, and support you with the job and/or graduate school application process.
